This project was originally assigned as the final assignment in my fourth-year Artificial Intelligence course.

I researched the N-Queens problem and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), and through my research and experimentation, I was able to develop a solution capable of handling sizes up to n = 500 million.

My professor, Dr. Ilias Kotsireas, was impressed by the result and encouraged me to further improve the algorithm and publish my solution both within the school and online.

Under his guidance, I developed a new solution in C that achieved record-time performance, proving that solutions are achievable within linear time.
